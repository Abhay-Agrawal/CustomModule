# CustomModule using GraphQl

# About GraphQl

* GraphQl is an open source server side technology which was developed by facebook to optimize RESTFUL API calls.
* It is an execution engine and a data query language.
* GraphQl structures data in the form of a graph with its powerful query syntax for traversing, retrieving and modifying data.
* The request made by a client to the GraphQl server is called a query.
* GraphQl is a query language for APIs - not a databases.
