# CustomModule using GraphQl

# About GraphQl

* GraphQl is an open source server side technology which was developed by facebook to optimize RESTFUL API calls.
* It is an execution engine and a data query language.
* GraphQl structures data in the form of a graph with its powerful query syntax for traversing, retrieving and modifying data.
* The request made by a client to the GraphQl server is called a query.
* GraphQl is a query language for APIs - not a databases.

# Module Structure

A GraphQL moduleâ€™s schema.graphqls file defines how the attributes defined in the module can be used in GraphQL queries and mutations.
The <module_name>/etc/schema.graphqls file:
* Defines the structure of queries and mutations.
* Determines which attributes can be used for input and output in GraphQL queries and mutations. Requests and responses contain separate lists of valid attributes.
* Points to the resolvers that verify and process the input data and response.
* Serves as the source for displaying the schema in a GraphQL browser.
* Defines which objects are cached.
            
# Resolver

*  A resolver performs GraphQL request processing.
* It is responsible for: 
  constructing a query 
  * fetching data
  * performing any calculations 
  * transforming the fetched and calculated data into a GraphQL array format
  * finally, it returns the query results for rendering
